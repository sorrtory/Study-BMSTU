# BMSTU the Bin

This repo contains some parts of labs and other IT tasks that I did at university.

---

Things I touched upon like

- C & Data Structures + Algorithms
- Lisp(Scheme) & Programming strategies
- Java/C++ & OOP
- Go & Discrete Math
- Go & Computer Networks
- Assembly

The point is to see my progress and keep it. \
Then I'll update the repo after passing the next exam.
